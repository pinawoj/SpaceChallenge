# Space Challenge

The mission is to send a list of items (Habitats, bunkers, food supplies, and rovers) to Mars, but it's important to run
some simulations first to pick the correct fleet of rockets.

There are two types of rockets:

- **U1** - can carry 18 tonnes of cargo, it cost $100 Million and weighs 10 tonnes
- **U2** - can carry 29 tonnes of cargo, it cost $120 Million and weighs 18 tonnes

The mission consists of 2 phases:

- **Phase-1** - we send building equipment and construction material to help build the colony
- **Phase-2** - we send the colony of humans along with some food resources

The main goal is to run some simulations and test both rocket types for each phase separately.
